# 🏗️ Pillars of System Design

System Design is the art of building **scalable, reliable, and maintainable** systems that serve millions of users efficiently.  
Every great system is built on a few **fundamental pillars** that guide architectural decisions.

## ⚙️ 1. Scalability

### **Definition**
Scalability is a system’s ability to **handle increased load** (users, requests, or data) by adding resources.

### **Types**
- **Vertical Scaling (Scale-Up):** Add more power (CPU/RAM) to a single machine.  
  > Example: Upgrading a single server.
- **Horizontal Scaling (Scale-Out):** Add more machines to distribute load.  
  > Example: Adding more servers behind a load balancer.

### **Key Concepts**
- Load Balancers (Nginx, HAProxy)  
- Database Sharding  
- Caching (Redis, Memcached)  
- Stateless Services  
- Auto-scaling (AWS EC2, Kubernetes)

### **Goal**
> Maintain performance and user experience as traffic grows.

## 🧠 2. Reliability

### **Definition**
Reliability ensures the system **functions correctly and consistently** even when components fail.

### **Practices**
- **Redundancy:** Replicate critical components or data across multiple servers.  
- **Failover Mechanisms:** Automatic switch to a backup system if the primary one fails.  
- **Data Replication:** Use replicas in databases to prevent data loss.  
- **Health Checks:** Continuously monitor system status.

### **Tools**
- AWS Multi-AZ Deployments  
- Database Replication (Primary–Replica setup)  
- Circuit Breaker Pattern  

### **Goal**
> The system should *gracefully degrade* instead of crashing completely.

## ⚡ 3. Performance

### **Definition**
Performance is how **fast** and **efficiently** a system responds to requests.

### **Metrics**
- **Latency:** Time taken to serve a single request.  
- **Throughput:** Number of requests handled per second.  

### **Techniques**
- Caching frequently accessed data  
- Using CDNs (Content Delivery Networks)  
- Optimizing database queries (indexes, denormalization)  
- Asynchronous Processing (Message Queues)  
- Minimizing network calls  

### **Goal**
> Deliver responses within acceptable time limits under any load.

## 🗄️ 4. Maintainability

### **Definition**
Maintainability is the system’s ease of **understanding, modifying, testing, and extending** over time.

### **Practices**
- Modular code architecture (microservices, layered design)  
- Proper documentation and naming conventions  
- CI/CD pipelines for automated deployment and testing  
- Consistent logging and monitoring  

### **Patterns**
- SOLID Principles  
- Separation of Concerns  
- Clean API contracts  

### **Goal**
> Make it easy for future engineers to improve or debug without breaking the system.

## 🧩 5. Availability

### **Definition**
Availability measures the **percentage of time the system is operational** and accessible to users.

### **Formula**
