Understanding Requirements Breaks requirements into functional (user login, search, payments) and non-functional (scalability, latency, availability). Thinks about how the system will behave under load. Focuses mainly on features, not performance or scale. May overlook concurrency, load, or fault tolerance. 2. Architecture Planning Designs an architecture diagram \u2014 uses microservices, databases, load balancers, caching, CDNs, and message queues. Plans for horizontal scaling. Starts coding everything in a monolithic way. No clear separation between services. Performance bottlenecks appear quickly. 3. Data Flow &amp; Storage Chooses appropriate databases (SQL for transactions, NoSQL for logs/cache). Designs schema, applies normalization/denormalization based on need. Uses a single database without considering performance or scaling. Might face slow queries and data inconsistency later. 4. Code &amp; Algorithms Uses DSA to write efficient code for search, sorting, caching, etc., and integrates it into the system architecture. Writes efficient local algorithms, but doesn\u2019t think about how they interact in a distributed system. 5. Handling Scale Implements caching (Redis), load balancing (NGINX), and asynchronous queues (Kafka) to handle millions of users. Relies solely on server performance. The app slows down or crashes under heavy traffic. 6. Reliability &amp; Monitoring Adds logging, monitoring, error recovery, and failover strategies. May not log or monitor performance. Debugging becomes hard in production. 7. Deployment Strategy Uses CI/CD pipelines, containerization (Docker, Kubernetes), and separates environments (dev/stage/prod). Deploys manually, risking downtime or configuration errors. 8. Team Collaboration Communicates using architectural terms: APIs, services, latency, scaling. Easily aligns with backend/frontend teams. Focuses only on local code; struggles to discuss architecture-level trade-offs. 9. Maintenance &amp; Future Growth System is modular, easy to extend, and ready for new features. System becomes tightly coupled and hard to scale or modify. 10. Outcome Commercial-ready, scalable, maintainable application. Can handle real-world traffic and growth. Prototype-level app that works locally but breaks in real-world conditions."},{"location":"01%20.%20system-design-vs-dsa/#key-takeaways","title":"\ud83e\udde0 Key Takeaways","text":""},{"location":"01%20.%20system-design-vs-dsa/#person-a-system-design-dsa","title":"Person A (System Design + DSA)","text":"<ul> <li>Thinks in terms of systems, not just functions.  </li> <li>Balances performance, scalability, and reliability.  </li> <li>Builds production-grade apps that can serve millions.  </li> <li>Is ready for mid/senior-level software engineering roles.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"01%20.%20system-design-vs-dsa/#person-b-only-dsa","title":"Person B (Only DSA)","text":"<ul> <li>Excels at solving isolated problems (like algorithmic challenges).  </li> <li>Can build features but lacks architectural vision.  </li> <li>Needs guidance to scale beyond basic prototypes.  </li> <li>Is well-suited for junior or algorithm-focused roles (e.g., competitive programming, coding contests).</li> </ul>"},{"location":"01%20.%20system-design-vs-dsa/#real-world-analogy","title":"\ud83d\udcac Real-World Analogy","text":"<p>DSA is like knowing how to craft powerful car engines, but System Design is knowing how to build an entire car \u2014 with brakes, gears, sensors, and a fuel system \u2014 that can handle the highway.</p> <p>A DSA-only engineer can build a fast prototype, but a System Design + DSA engineer can build a reliable, scalable product.</p>"},{"location":"01%20.%20system-design-vs-dsa/#final-thought","title":"\ud83e\udded Final Thought","text":"<p>If you aim to build real-world applications or lead engineering projects, DSA alone is not enough \u2014 System Design is the missing bridge between algorithms and architecture.</p> <p>DSA makes you efficient.
