# 🧱 System Design & Design Patterns Repository

Welcome to **Raj Gupta’s System Design & Design Pattern Notes** —  
a comprehensive collection of principles, UML diagrams, examples, and C++ implementations  
covering both **High-Level Design (HLD)** and **Low-Level Design (LLD)** concepts.

---

## 📘 Overview

This repository is designed to help you:
- Understand **software architecture and modular design**.
- Learn **OOP, SOLID principles, UML diagrams**, and **system-level thinking**.
- Explore **creational, structural, and behavioral design patterns** with **C++ examples**.
- Apply **design patterns in real-world systems** like Food Delivery Apps, Notification Systems, and Music Players.

Each Markdown file (`.md`) is easy to read, MkDocs-compatible, and includes diagrams (via Mermaid.js) and explanations.
